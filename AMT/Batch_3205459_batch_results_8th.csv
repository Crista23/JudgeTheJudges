Also, I feel that it takes nowhere near 15 minutes to complete this task. I was very surprised there were only 21 sentiments for $1.50, though it's not uncommon with surveys to have that much pay per time. I looked over each of these reviews 3 times and even with a bit of confusion I'm fairly confident in my answers, so instead of afking on this page pretending, I figured I'd say this, Turkers usually look at 10c per minute = $6 an hour, generally 20-25c per minute is a good ideal. For work like this, with careful amounts, any less and you will get people, but they generally won't be forthcoming with their information as much. Writing requirements are usually avoided or a bit extra, though at this price most people are happy to write a bit. Just hoping this might help out some people who have gotten this HIT done fairly thoroughly while also doing it quickly.I assume a fair amount of the grammatical error reviews are fake, again I'm a little confused on some of them, but it might be the text screwing up from the website to mTurk. There were a few reviews I could probably confirm real due to the nature of the product names involved, such as shaun ___ and hot ___ are movies I'm very familiar with. If there are fakes I didn't catch, they're probably pretty good.","","male","0","16","43","native","fake","real","real","real","real","real","real","fake","real","real","real","real","real","real","fake","real","fake","real","fake","real","fake","MLESeqGAN","Real","SkipConnectionsAC","Real","MLESeqGAN","Real","Real","RankGAN","Real","Real","SkipConnectionsAC","Real","AttentionAC","Real","LeakGAN","Real","Real","SeqGAN","SeqGAN","WordRNN05","GoogleLM"
